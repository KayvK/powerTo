### This code is terrible, don't actually use it. If you want your computer
### to NOT catch on fire, it is best you avoid using this at all costs.
Seriously, unless your computer has a death wish, this code should not
be used.
### Read Me
This Readme was made manually by hand. It is basically pointless,
seeing as no one will ever use this on Git nor will I ever publish
it on there.
### This turned out to be false, as I am terrible at keeping promises.
